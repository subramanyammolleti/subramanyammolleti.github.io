*Hey there!* This is my first Post, I love Computer Scence and to write technical stuff, i 
have used paid hosting with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) for a while. I don't know 
why i'm not satisfied may be because of paying $10-$20 bucks for the hosting. Recently i 
have come across a [Blog Post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by 
[Joshualande](https://twitter.com/joshualande). I loved the idea of hosting on [Github Pages]
(https://pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole),
So i have setup one for myself, It's saves $10-$20/year. 
Pretty Good ha.

I'm planning to write some articles on various things like

* Java
* Javascript
* Linux
* Some other on Latest Technologies

I'm interested in *Algorithms*, i'm not pretty good at them i want to master some of the basic *Algorithms* in
the near future.

Cheers
