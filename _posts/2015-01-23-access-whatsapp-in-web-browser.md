*Hi! People* Now, WhatsApp can be connected on web browser too, with a Google Chrome browser(Ya! Only Chrome). Well This would be very helpful to the people who will be working on a PC and takes their phones and send replies to their WhatsApp messages all the time when they get a message.

Things to do to use WhatsApp on Chrome.

1. Update `WhatsApp app` to the latest version in your Mobile.

2. Open this [site](https://web.whatsapp.com/) on PC

3. Open `Menu Option in WhatsApp` in that Choose `WhatsApp Web` from the menu, Scan the code inside of WhatsApp, and you’re done. Now your paired with the WhatsApp web client.

Let the Browser on your PC load WhatsApp UI, Your phone needs to `stay connected to the internet` for web client to work.

Sorry about `iPhone Users`,as mentioned in `WhatsApp offical post`, Apple platform has `limitations` so they couldn't provide a `webclient for iPhone users`. This service is currently available for `Android`, `Windows` and `Blackberry` users for now. If your struck do post in your queries, i will get back to you asap.

Hope this helped, Thanks for reading <br>
cheers.
