*Hi! People* Now, WhatsApp can be connected on web browser too, with a Google Chrome browser(Ya! Only Chrome). Well This would be very helpful to the people who will be working on a PC and takes their phones and send replies to their WhatsApp messages all the time when they get a message.

Things to do to use WhatsApp on Chrome.

1. Update `WhatsApp app` to the latest version in your Mobile.

2. Download any `QR Code Reader`, I would recommend this app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=la.droid.qr&hl=en), [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/qr-code-scanner/352fad4a-6f14-4508-a09a-818b417ea634), [Blackberry](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/13962/?countrycode=IN&lang=en)

3. Open this [site](https://web.whatsapp.com/) on PC

4. Open `QR Reader App` place your phone near the `QR Code` and let the phone scan, Now close QR Code app.

5. Open `Menu Option in WhatsApp` in that Choose `WhatsApp Web` from the menu, Scan the code inside of WhatsApp, and youâ€™re done. Now your paired with the WhatsApp web client.

Let the Browser on your PC load WhatsApp UI, Your phone needs to `stay connected to the internet` for web client to work.

Sorry about `iPhone Users`,as mentioned in `WhatsApp offical post`, Apple platform has `limitations` so they couldn't provide a `webclient for iPhone users`. This service is currently available for `Android`, `Windows` and `Blackberry` users for now. If your struck do post in your queries, i will get back to you asap.

Hope this helped, Thanks for reading <br>
cheers.
