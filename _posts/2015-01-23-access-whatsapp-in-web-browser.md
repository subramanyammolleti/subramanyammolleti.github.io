*Hi! People* Now, WhatsApp can be connected on web browser too, with a Google Chrome browser(Ya! Only Chrome, You must be knowing why it is only Chrome). Well This would be very helpful to the people who will be working on a PC and takes their phones and send replies to their WhatsApp messages all the time when they get a message.

Things to do to use WhatsApp on Chrome.

1. Update `WhatsApp app` to the latest version in your Mobile.

2. Download any `QR Code Reader`, I would recommend this [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=la.droid.qr&hl=en)

3. Open this [site](https://web.whatsapp.com/)

4. Open `QR Reader` place your phone near the `QR Code` and let the phone scan, Now close QR Code app.

5. Open `Menu Option in WhatsApp` in that Choose `WhatsApp Web` from the menu, Scan the code inside of WhatsApp, and youâ€™re done. Now your paired with the WhatsApp web client.

Your phone needs to `stay connected to the internet` for web client to work.

Sorry about `iPhone Users`, This service is currently available to `Android`, `Windows` and `Blackberry` users.

Hope this helped, Thanks for reading
cheers.
