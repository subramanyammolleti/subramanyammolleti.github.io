  Hey there! This is Subramanyam Molleti who loves Computer Science and 
  Open Source, I love to spend time on My Ubuntu Machine learning something.

I have Done Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at [JNTUK](http://www.jntuk.edu.in/). Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer in [Smart IMS Inc.](http://www.smartims.com/) at it's *Hyderabad Development Center.* 

I'm interested in *Web, Open Source, Mobile and Algorithms.*

I will start learning *Algorithms* soon. If you would like to say hello or something [Ping Me](https://twitter.com/_MSubramanyam), I would love to get back to you.

Thanks for reading!
