  Hey there! This is Subramanyam Molleti who loves Computer Science and 
  Open Source, I love to spend time on My Ubuntu Machine learning something.
</p>

I have Done Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at [JNTUK](http://www.jntuk.edu.in/). Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Infosys.](https://www.infosys.com/).

I'm interested in *Javascript, Open Source, Mobile and Algorithms.*

I will start learning *Algorithms* soon. If you would like to say hello or something [Ping Me](http://smolleti.com/), I would love to get back to you.

Thanks for reading!
